# Top-6-Quito
This was one of my first projects I created in my web development class, during Fall Semester 2017. 

The requirements for this project said that it had to be a 3 paged informational static site. It had to have images, links to the other pages, comments, and other basic HTML elements. We also had to have a stylesheet for every page. I went one further and implemented responsive design, a nav bar, and a video (not on GitHub because itâ€™s so large).
