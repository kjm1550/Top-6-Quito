# Top-6-Quito
This was one of my first projects I created in my web development class, during Fall Semester 2017.

For this project I created a 3 page informational static site. It had to have images, links to the other pages, comments, other basic HTML elements, and a stylesheet for every page. Although not required, I implemented responsive design, a nav bar, and a video (not on GitHub because it is so large).
